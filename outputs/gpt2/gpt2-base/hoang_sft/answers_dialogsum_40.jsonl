However, my recommendation is to utilize the recent economic realities we have in the entertainment business. To my mind, there are several compelling reasons that can inform my calculus:\n\n1. Lower cost of subscriptions. As current box-to-box business operations can sustainably lower programming costs, we should reduce our reliance on box-to-box sales.\n2. Increased consumption of new kinds of content. We should encourage new models of content creation, where we can include both new content and more content-oriented content.\n3. More languages. I find it intuitive to use machine learning in training for complex visual arts projects.\n4. More ML tools.

Furthermore, if the business is made of a lukewarm material, it won\u2019t be sustainable, as it is adding to the chaos of the office.\n\nBut we can\u2019t seem to solve that problem without putting a heavy focus on the movies. In our example, we spend a lot of money on digital advertising, yet when we spend a lot of time on going after content, it becomes increasingly more challenging for our personal life. Additionally, because we are too dependent on technology, especially for creating and maintaining high-quality product experiences, the effects of video games on society are extremely distressing.
