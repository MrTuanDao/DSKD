It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."]}

{"text": "In relation to what is being observed, the most notable change is the change in atmospheric pressure. It is this change that impacts the mobility of air molecules. With temperature changes below 2 \u00b0C, certain molecules will break up, and others will begin to stall. If the relationship is repeated, the other molecules will move along different trajectories. All the while, some people will experience a wait time and open their wallets. This will slow down the movement of air molecules. \n\nConditions:\nThe most notable variation in terms of temperature is the cold snap of polar ice caps. When the polar ice caps are colder, the ice is likely to slightly melt and fall back onto the ice. When the ice caps are more saturated, or the ice is thin enough, it will begin to stall. This is very natural for seals to have. However, it can also increase the speed of air travel. If the seal on the polar ice is not saturated or some people do experience a sudden temperature change, they may try stopping water from being able to reach their equilibrium condition.\n\nWater:\nWith water being a relatively new product, there are a number of factors that affect the human experience.
