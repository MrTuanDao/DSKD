No matter where you come from, what you look like and who you love. Football is there for everyone and our sport must stand up for the people across the world who face discrimination and exclusion,\u201d said Germany captain Manuel Neuer.\n\u201cI am proud to be sending out this message with my colleagues from the other national teams. Every single voice counts.\u201d\nIn June, England\u2019s captain Harry Kane revealed that he had discussed taking a collective stance regarding human rights in Qatar with Denmark\u2019s Christian Eriksen and France captain Hugo Lloris.\n\u201cI am honored to join my fellow national team captains in supporting the important OneLove campaign,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\u201cAs captains we may all be competing against each other on the pitch, but we stand together against all forms of discrimination. This is even more relevant at a time when division is common in society. Wearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching.\u201d"]}

While the ingredients in the apple muffin are mixed together, you can use your fingers to press the coals of the muffin. Make sure the muffin is very soft.\n3. When cooking a good apple muffal, you should use a food processor that can help you accomplish most tasks like removing or slicing the apple. You must use a food processor that has a nice temperature to both cook and cook the apple muffin. If you don't know an oven (or any), you can use a food processor that you may have worked with earlier in your cooking process.\n4. When you are ready to eat your apple muffal, you can add aromatics, such as apple cider vinegar, to the apple sauce. This gives your apple a distinct savory flavor that is seldom overpowering.\n5. This will help the apple muffin to have a more drinkable consistency, and cook more tasty meals.", "answer": ["Let me tell you this, apple muffins are extremely easy to make, and they are totally worth the effort.

It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without.
