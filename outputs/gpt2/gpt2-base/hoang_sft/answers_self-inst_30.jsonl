The syntax of the == operator is similar to the C programming language's \"find and delete\" method. For example, \"findandexchange\" is a special method that allows you to find all your symbols relative to a single list. \"find all\" means that the first letter of the string (usually early in the alphabet) is lost in \"find all\" where the first letter of the alphabet is highlighted. This is helpful when a pattern is found in a file (such as a Sudoku file).\n\nThe difference between the two methods is that in Java, the string you've created is compared between two similar strings, so \"find and destroy\" is equivalent to \"maple\".", "answer": ["== tests for reference equality (whether they are the same object).\n.equals() tests for value equality (whether they are logically \"equal\").\nObjects.equals() checks for null before calling .equals() so you don't have to (available as of JDK7, also available in Guava).\nConsequently, if you want to test whether two strings have the same value you will probably want to use Objects.equals().\nYou almost always want to use Objects.equals(). In the rare situation where you know you're dealing with interned strings, you can use ==."]}

Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish.

A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.\nThe free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride.

{"text": "While it is generally true that trade does not promote economic value or society, the \"Fair Trade\" movement has its own political ideology and is in part likely influenced by the idea that free markets promote trade. For example, some proponents of the trade trade motion cite the increased potential for workers to develop skills in foreign service industry. Others suggest that increased consumption of locally produced goods (or \"labor products\") would promote the creation of a global economy.\n\nThis debate has generated a large number of opinion, with some arguing that trade should be codified as an economic right and others arguing that it should not be codified.", "answer": ["The \"fair trade\" movement, also known as the \"trade justice\" movement, promotes the use of labour, environmental and social standards for the production of commodities, particularly those exported from the Third and Second Worlds to the First World.

Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of goods made using slave labour to minimum price support schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s. Non-governmental organizations also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as independent monitors of compliance with labeling requirements.

It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns.

It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without.
