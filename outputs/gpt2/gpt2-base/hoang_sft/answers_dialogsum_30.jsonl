Staying up to date on our commitments is the most important factor in this decision.", "answer": ["#Person2# thinks the movie industry should be revolutionized to survive the threat from DVD industry."]}
{"text": "No, I do not believe movies will replace cinemas. The main reason is cost. TheDVD players, by definition, are expensive to produce and usually require sub-par performances. There are several reasons why this is such a huge waste. First, the characters and actresses for whom the production is directed are often in high demand for these services. Second, the schedule and cost of producing movies is usually very expensive, so many actors are forced to work in theaters to maintain their performance. Lastly, because there are fewer people working at the same time, each director usually has more to spend time on location than the other, increasing the efficiency of the production. This makes it hard to produce the same movie for all audiences.\n\nBut, I do think the possibilities presented by movies are for a reason. For example, we are losing our ability to watch a movie in 2023 with a highly variable cast. When we consider the box office space, the next logical step is to find a director who can sustain the legacy that we have. We have to consider, first, what do we need to lose and then decide if we can sustain that performance for the future.", "answer": ["#Person1# and #Person2# talk about the possible destiny of movie theatre."]}
