This has led to a number of large scale cases that are threatening to put restrictions on trade. Similarly, the debate around trade is often conducted with increasing pressure on governments to increase the extraction of commodities. While it is often true that trade is used to promote human progress, the term fair trade believes that it should only be codified as a socially compact means to achieve economic development.\nThe first World Trade Organization (WHO) officially recognized the conditions for the importation of commodities into the United States of America back in 1995. In addition, the World Bank has designated the 48th parallel organization for the transport of commodities into and out of North America. The transfer of commodities is also viewed as a positive step toward enhancing economic health and longevity.

Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of goods made using slave labour to minimum price support schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s. Non-governmental organizations also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as independent monitors of compliance with labeling requirements.

It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money.
