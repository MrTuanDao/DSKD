At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy.

It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."]}

{"text": "English constituency parsing is the same problem as any other job in any other field.  It requires no specialisation or recognition by the government.  The Only differences between English constituencies and other candidates are the frequency of the jobs, the types of the houses, and the types of people in the constituency.  For example, in the English language, the only people who are guaranteed to be on some of the jobs are the members of the Labour Party and the newspapers and the radio. In the German language, it is the only party that has a general election if it is performed on all the people.", "answer": ["English constituency parsing is a task in natural language processing where the goal is to analyze the syntactic structure of a sentence in English.
