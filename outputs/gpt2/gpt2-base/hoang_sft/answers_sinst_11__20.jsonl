Yann Martel's ideas are to explain what happened and give us insight into the evolutionary state of the world. In the first place, he suggests that the average human's phenotype changes because of the increase in the number of mutations in the human genome. Then he explains the concept of an electric field: an electric field is a region in which electrons are attracted to the nuclei of the same way that electrons are attracted to the human nuclei.
