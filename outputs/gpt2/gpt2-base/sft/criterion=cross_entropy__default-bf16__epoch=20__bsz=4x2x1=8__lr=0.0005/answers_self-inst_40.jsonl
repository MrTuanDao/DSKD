{"text": "I was using Python APIs this morning to explore coding. I was using Python APIs to get data returned for training. To get data returned I would need to write a checker log to match the request with a unique identifier like a keyword in the Python API. I would start with the statement \"class\" so that the app can run automatically. Each token in the sequence can have an assigned value. For example, if I were to write a code (\"one.ai\") three times, I would get a new code slice from the code that I was trying to get replaced. Each token can have a name that is used to serialize the code. I would also get the message items from the python API so that I can work with the code slice. The last step is to add some redundancy in the code which could be too many.

It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved."]}

It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it.
