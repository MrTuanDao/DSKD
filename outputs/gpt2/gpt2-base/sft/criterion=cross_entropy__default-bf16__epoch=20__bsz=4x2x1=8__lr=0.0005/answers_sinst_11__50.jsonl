Second, it's important to understand that not all people are the same -- no matter how your AI system works.  If you see that you are struggling to understand the question correctly and correctly, you won't be able to save your money.  You should help me by being more creative.  If you're being especially unlucky because you don't have time to dedicate to the topic you're trying to answer, you should eliminate the disruptor.

In our example the pewter is responsible for changing the pewter from 150 lbs to 180 lbs.  This means the pewter has to be in the same position twice per rotation.
