To sell his signature \"blue meth,\" he teams up with Jesse Pinkman, a former student of his. The meth makes them very rich very quickly, but it attracts the attention of his DEA brother in law Hank. As Walt and Jesse's status in the drug world escalates, Walt becomes a dangerous criminal and Jesse becomes a hot-headed salesman. Hank is always hot on his tail, and it forces Walt to come up with new ways to cover his tracks."]}

{"text": "Zinc is required for good health if the immune system is not functioning.", "answer": ["Although zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.\nThe free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride.

It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved."]}

{"text": "The green light symbolizes at the end of the books.", "answer": ["The green light symbolizes several different things to different characters throughout the book, but overall, it stands for the inaccessibility of the American Dream. At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."]}
