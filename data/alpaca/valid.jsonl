This segmentation technique can be used to tailor a product or service to the needs of the customer by closely examining customer data that is collected through surveys and market research. \n\nIn contrast, psychographic segmentation is based on customer lifestyle and personality. This approach is used to determine the interests and values of a customer, as well as their buying habits, interests, and lifestyle. Psychographic segmentation helps companies to identify certain customer groups with certain values, beliefs, and interests that they can appeal to with their products or services. \n\nBoth demographic and psychographic segmentation are useful methods to categorize customers, however they each have different advantages. Demographic segmentation can be done quickly and easily, which is why it is commonly used and often the starting point for a market segmentation. Psychographic segmentation can be more helpful to differentiate and define target markets, as it reveals lifestyle and values which are more closely associated with attitudes and behaviour. Ultimately, a combination of the two segmentation methods can provide a more accurate picture of a customer\u2019s characteristics and needs, enabling companies to better target their marketing strategies and deliver better products and services to their customers.", "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

Lazarus' poem, on the other hand, reflects on the hopes of immigrants and those who seek a better life in America. While her poem has a heavy sense of patriotism and pride, her words carry an unspoken advocacy for worthy immigrants. \n\nThe style and structure of both poems is a stark contrast. Burns' poem has a traditional, lyrical flow with vivid imagery, while Lazarus' work is a sonnet with a strict rhyme scheme. This is reflective of the difference in the ways they portray their respective messages. While Burns' poem centers around romanticized and idealized love, Lazarus' work speaks to America as a country of immigrants, projecting hope and a greater future. \n\nDespite the differences, both poems offer a sense of optimism. Burns' poem implies that with passion and patience, things can still turn out right even though his own love life may not have. Lazarus' poem acknowledges the struggles that immigrants face, yet still speaks to nationalism and a greater dream ahead. Both writers draw attention to values of hope, courage and hope in the face of adversity.
