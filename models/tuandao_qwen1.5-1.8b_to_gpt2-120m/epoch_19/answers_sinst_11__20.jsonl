However, there are couple of reasons that non-fluent sentence does not fit in the description.  \n\nFirst, let's assume that the language of the story is not precluded by the pre-existing clause.  In that case, the language of the story must be used in the opening lines of the story. \n\nIf the pre-existing sentence is 4, then the word 'boiled.'  This means that the entire sentence is 4, with no special word originating from the original language. \n\nIf another word is 4, then the last word in the paragraph is what is considered \"boiled.\"  This means that the word 'boiled' is not allowed to be used in its proper form.\n\nIf all of the other words are of the same form, then the sentence 'boiled' can be understood differently.
