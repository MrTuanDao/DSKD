The simplest way is to use the == operator, but in a programming language. It's the same as a string method in our traditional languages, so you can use it in any number of contexts.\n\nYou can use the == operator in your code. This means that you can compare any consecutive strings to their corresponding values. Some example of this is the following:\n\nIf a == operator is:\n\n1. \"I was the number one person in the 2 seat car\".\n2. \"I was the 10th person in the 3 seat\".\n3. \"I was the strongest woman in the 3 seat\".", "answer": ["== tests for reference equality (whether they are the same object).\n.equals() tests for value equality (whether they are logically \"equal\").\nObjects.equals() checks for null before calling .equals() so you don't have to (available as of JDK7, also available in Guava).\nConsequently, if you want to test whether two strings have the same value you will probably want to use Objects.equals().\nYou almost always want to use Objects.equals().

Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish.

Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of goods made using slave labour to minimum price support schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s.

It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved."]}

At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without.
