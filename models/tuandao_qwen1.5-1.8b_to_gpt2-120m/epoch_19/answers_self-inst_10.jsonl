Close the pouring opening by using a knife or other thin object, bending the opening back up so it almost where it was before the beverage can was opened.\nStep 2: Nozzel Jets\nMake a couple of holes in the side of the can, about half way up, opposite each other using a small drill. The diameter of the holes should be about the same as the thin plastic tubing to be used as jet nozzles. Enlarge the holes so they are elliptical allowing the nozzle tubes to lie parallel against the cans side.\nStep 3: Making a Pressure Vessel\nSeal the top of the opened can using super glue and baking soda to make a small pressure vessel. Add some super glue to the closed opening and then sprinkle on some baking soda - they will combine to make a plastic. Keep adding super glue and baking soda until the top is sealed.\nStep 4: Attaching the Nozzle Jets\nFit in the thin plastic tubes to the holes drilled in the sides of the can and seal with super glue and baking soda. Try to have the tubes pointing horizontal in the direction you want to rotate the can when the steam exits the nozzles.\nStep 5: Creating Steam\nAdd a little water into the can though one of the nozzles. Just add maybe a teaspoon or so. \nStep 6: In Action\nThe can was suspended from a tripod over the methylated sprits flame. After a couple of minutes enough steam had built up to rotate the can."]}

{"text": "The green light symbolizes at the end of the novel?", "answer": ["The green light symbolizes several different things to different characters throughout the book, but overall, it stands for the inaccessibility of the American Dream. At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."]}
