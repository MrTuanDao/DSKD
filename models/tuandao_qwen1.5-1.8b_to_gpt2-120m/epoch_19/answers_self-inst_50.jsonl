Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."]}
{"text": "Keeping track of your anxiety is a key thing which can help improve your concentration and memory in the brain. The first step is to observe the triggering patterns and understand the causal effect. Once, we identify the time block, try to compartmentalize your feelings and back thoughts. Fill those time blocks or duration of the day with an useful activity such as engaging in a physical activity or picking up sports. When you are ready for any of these activities, you can start planning your activities and plan your weekend and evenings with activities to switch off. Pick up a hobby which you are interested in. Try activities that you are interested in and keep that activity as short as possible. Once you have decided on all those activities, begin recording time with your favorite activities and watch what you are doing. Then, consider working out and practicing meditation.
