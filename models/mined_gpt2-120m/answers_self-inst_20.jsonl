It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without.

If it moves, tell how it is moving.\n4- Now for the good part, close your eyes and try changing this picture. Change how it moves. Slow it done shrink its size. Try to move it away from your body. Imagine it fading. Keep doing this until you feel like you can change how it feels. Changing which submodality helped you curb your anxiety? Was it its shape, size, or something else?\n5- Do you feel better now?"]}
