Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of goods made using slave labour to minimum price support schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s.

It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns.

At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without.
