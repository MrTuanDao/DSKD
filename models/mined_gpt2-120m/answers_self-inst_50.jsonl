These are just some of the requirements of being a good health practitioner.", "answer": ["Although zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.\nThe free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach."]}
{"text": "Fair trade is a method of enabling the exchange of goods and services by using money to produce and sell those goods, often driven by the belief that the UK is the best in the world. In this case, Britain is the only country to have the largest employment of a manufacturing industry, with the highest average rate of wage income for workers (which is generally taxed at the level of about  per week) over a year. This is a growing market, and the demand for goods and services has increased over the last few years. Additionally, in a less crowded economy, the cost of goods and services has decreased as the demand for goods has increased. In this light, a number of factors have contributed to the high cost of goods and services, including, but not limited to, the cost of transportation.\n\nFair trade generally views the outcome of a trade outcome as a collection of issues that are par with the amount of money being spent or the quantity of goods. The issues are often due to social and economic differences, which can lead to labor shortages and industrial shortages.", "answer": ["The \"fair trade\" movement, also known as the \"trade justice\" movement, promotes the use of labour, environmental and social standards for the production of commodities, particularly those exported from the Third and Second Worlds to the First World. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right.\nImporting firms voluntarily adhere to fair trade standards or governments may enforce them through a combination of employment and commercial law. Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of goods made using slave labour to minimum price support schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s. Non-governmental organizations also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as independent monitors of compliance with labeling requirements.

At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without.

{"text": "One of the toughest workouts with Strava is single elimination. Strava is a one time non-contact team sport that requires all players to be at the same time. The rules are pretty simple, but the hardest part is getting to a point where you have to win an entire set of workout sets. Moreover, the workout is a time-consuming and dangerous type of exercise. As time gets shorter, the longer the person will be pushing harder, but the point is still a good exercise for multiple people. Besides the obvious difficulty of completing the lift, there are some extra benefits to having a team of athletes that are able to participate in the lift. For example, if one participant is able to participate in  of  the  200,000-mile distance, then that would be the highest value of all. In the USA, we can partition into irlnamed \"Big 3\" or \"Big \". This allows for even a small group of people to participate in a small exercise set, which could be as short as a     1 mile run. In many cities,  the workout is as short as an  1 mile run, and can be as long as an     mile run. \n\nAnother common workout type", "answer": ["This month, push yourself to log 30 hours of whatever activities get you stoked to move.

{"text": "This is a simple sentence. \"With a little give in us\" is the same as \"with a little give in us.\" This is a good question for a person who cannot answer the question. \"You should have seen the look on their face when they say 'with a little give in.\"", "answer": ["It means with some space to move. It's a metaphor. \"Give\" is a noun here. It's meaning is similar to\"flexibility\". If something has no \"give\" it's tight and rigid. It's the opposite of flexible and loose.
