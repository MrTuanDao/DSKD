If we're taking a specific path through the string, one might try to use the index operator to compare the strings acrossorg by taking the string, but in my case, it's not the case.  The indexer should be either the first string that's been calculated, or the second string that's been calculated.  If we take the same path through the string, they should be either the same or the same.  And if we can independently execute the method, they should be the same.  The key differences between the two methods are that string distance between the index and the type of string that has been calculated.  The second string contains the clue that helps us understand the underlying structure of the string, and the guesses that exist in the string.

Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."]}
