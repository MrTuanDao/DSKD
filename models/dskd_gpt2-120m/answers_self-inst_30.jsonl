With the OneLove band we express this message,\u201d said Virgil van Dijk, the Netherlands captain.\n\u201cOn behalf of the Dutch team I have been wearing this band for quite a while now. It is good to see that other countries are joining this initiative.\u201d\nOneLove was founded in the Netherlands in 2020 to emphasize that all football fans have at least one thing in common \u2013 their love of football \u2013 and to speak out against any form of discrimination.\nAs well as focusing on public messaging, the initiative has also developed to offer diversity training to grassroots club.\n\u201cOur love of football unites us all. No matter where you come from, what you look like and who you love. Football is there for everyone and our sport must stand up for the people across the world who face discrimination and exclusion,\u201d said Germany captain Manuel Neuer.\n\u201cI am proud to be sending out this message with my colleagues from the other national teams. Every single voice counts.\u201d\nIn June, England\u2019s captain Harry Kane revealed that he had discussed taking a collective stance regarding human rights in Qatar with Denmark\u2019s Christian Eriksen and France captain Hugo Lloris.\n\u201cI am honored to join my fellow national team captains in supporting the important OneLove campaign,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\u201cAs captains we may all be competing against each other on the pitch, but we stand together against all forms of discrimination. This is even more relevant at a time when division is common in society. Wearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching.\u201d"]}

These functions include the following: keeping the body healthy, lowering blood pressure,  protecting the joints and organs and keeping the skin healthy.", "answer": ["Although zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.\nThe free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach."]}

It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved."]}

It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money.

Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it.
