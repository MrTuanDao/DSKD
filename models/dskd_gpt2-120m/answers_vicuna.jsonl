{"text": "Small, locally-owned businesses tend to be more affordable than large chains stores.  The reason for that is that they typically offer less when ordering from within the United States.  In contrast, large chains stores are often located in more expensive stores, which can make the store more expensive.  The reason for that is that local businesses tend to offer more, since they typically offer more of the same product at a higher price."}

{"text": "The earth orbited the Sun between its start and end. Its spin axis is tilted with respect to its orbital plane. The side of the earth is closer to the sun gets more heat from the sun. That is why the earth's spin axis is tilted at 90 degrees. On the other hand, if we were to say the earth was orbited by the sun, the angle would be equal to 90 degrees. The sun is a sphere, so the angle of the earth is approximately 360 degrees.\n\nNow, let's say the earth was orbited by the sun for 5.6 minutes. The sun takes the first 45.6 minutes. Then it takes the second 45.6 minutes to complete its rotation. The angle of the earth is 270 degrees. So the angle of the earth is 270 degrees."}
