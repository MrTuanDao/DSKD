{"text": "The given article may be checked for any scientific issues or errors.", "answer": ["Although zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.\nThe free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach."]}

It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns.

It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without.
