{"text": "The green light symbolizes at the end of the novel", "answer": ["The green light symbolizes several different things to different characters throughout the book, but overall, it stands for the inaccessibility of the American Dream. At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."]}
