For example, China has 2.14 million tons of unused land area and over 300 million tons of forest land. We can therefore afford to listen to the other side and not impose environmental restrictions. Additionally, we can also try to buy more wood and fresh pollen because each country has about the same amount of land.\n\n(4) Reduce consumption - The cost of new generation is cheaper than new generation.
