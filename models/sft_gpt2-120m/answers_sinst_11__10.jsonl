When we say the square footage is \" Dubai\", we means the square footage of that entire city, plus the amount of people that live there, and the amount of goods and services people offers.  An example of this is \"two bridges, two clubs, four clubs, four peas, four scooters, and five wheels\". \n\nThe last part of the question is that the person who says \"I'm going to Dubai\" is not specifying our destination.
