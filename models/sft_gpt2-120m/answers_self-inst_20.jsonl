With the OneLove band we express this message,\u201d said Virgil van Dijk, the Netherlands captain.\n\u201cOn behalf of the Dutch team I have been wearing this band for quite a while now.

Football is there for everyone and our sport must stand up for the people across the world who face discrimination and exclusion,\u201d said Germany captain Manuel Neuer.\n\u201cI am proud to be sending out this message with my colleagues from the other national teams. Every single voice counts.\u201d\nIn June, England\u2019s captain Harry Kane revealed that he had discussed taking a collective stance regarding human rights in Qatar with Denmark\u2019s Christian Eriksen and France captain Hugo Lloris.\n\u201cI am honored to join my fellow national team captains in supporting the important OneLove campaign,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\u201cAs captains we may all be competing against each other on the pitch, but we stand together against all forms of discrimination. This is even more relevant at a time when division is common in society. Wearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching.\u201d"]}

Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of goods made using slave labour to minimum price support schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s.
