It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip.

Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without.

{"text": "Nothing screams simplicity when you are asking people to complete a training challenge.  Joining a simple training course or a group of people who cannot complete the same training can be an effective exercise for many.  Not only does it help you build a sense of purpose and fun into your everyday activities, but it also teaches discipline and responsibility.   As a result, all three of your most important skill areas will be equally applicable in helping each other.   Let's assume that you are asking for a spot in the bar.  You are training to make a challenging decision, and while this is a great opportunity, you will still need to make a choice in your heart and be ready to handle the responsibility of completing the challenge.  On the other hand, a challenge can also bring you great enjoyment, because many of the processes of training do not involve sending bodyweight or high intensity training.  So not only does the instructor teach you the rules and how to execute, but it also teaches you the discipline and responsibility you have to take into account.  Joining a training camp will also help you to build sense of purpose while completing the challenge, and while this is an important process, it is still an effective way to help each other.", "answer": ["This month, push yourself to log 30 hours of whatever activities get you stoked to move.
