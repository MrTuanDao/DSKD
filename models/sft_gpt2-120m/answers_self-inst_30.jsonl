The five \"powers\" in the series are presented counterintuitively - we see a lot of them in the third episode, \"Harlem\" - the first real power struggle between Sauron's armies and the Kobold hordes of Sauronians; a lot of the \"powers\" in the show are actually working things we are told throughout the series. We understand that when we take the first few episodes, everything in the series goes wrong.\n\nBut the most interesting part of the series is the \"set\" of \"The Wheel of Time\" by Robert Jordan.

{"text": "At a high level, directors Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese are very good friends.  They spend time together during the filming process and are often engaged in physical showings.  During those scenes, they express emotionally through clear, even emotional communication.  There are some scenes that are \u201cno evidence\u201d of love, even though they are still in various versions of the same scene.  These scenes serve as the foundation for many of the Tarantino movies.  They are also the perfect backdrop for another use of the Tarantino technique, which is to create a large scale shot in front of a screen.  There is also a sequence of silent, which only lets you hear the sound of the actors, which is a eerie clap noise.  Finally, the director frequently plans the direction of the shot, and also makes sure the actors follow the same plan mentally,  keeping in order to create the illusionary, even though in actuality, the shot is a sequence.  There are many other sequences that are never seen in the movies, only the occasional hidden footage or computer graphic noise cancellation.

The diameter of the holes should be about the same as the thin plastic tubing to be used as jet nozzles. Enlarge the holes so they are elliptical allowing the nozzle tubes to lie parallel against the cans side.\nStep 3: Making a Pressure Vessel\nSeal the top of the opened can using super glue and baking soda to make a small pressure vessel. Add some super glue to the closed opening and then sprinkle on some baking soda - they will combine to make a plastic.

{"text": "The green light symbolize at end of the book?", "answer": ["The green light symbolizes several different things to different characters throughout the book, but overall, it stands for the inaccessibility of the American Dream. At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."]}
