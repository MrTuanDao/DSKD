Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.\nThe free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride.

{"text": "While it is generally considered that trade is a human right, the term \"trade justice\" has its own connotations, and reflects that in the context of a free trading society, the first sustainable prospect is the prospect of creating a national economy based on the exploitation of labour or resources. This modern-day trade system is fraught with several wars of exploitation, where the exploitation of labour is a major issue. This is leading to an increase in the demand for products and services, with the increasing demand for jobs and the number of new workers rising. Yet, the term \"trade\" has been regularly used by both ends of the political spectrum in which both sides of the political spectrum view the exploitation of labour as an unjust and inequitable process.", "answer": ["The \"fair trade\" movement, also known as the \"trade justice\" movement, promotes the use of labour, environmental and social standards for the production of commodities, particularly those exported from the Third and Second Worlds to the First World.

Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of goods made using slave labour to minimum price support schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s.

{"text": "The green light symbolize at end of the book because students can read it in any order", "answer": ["The green light symbolizes several different things to different characters throughout the book, but overall, it stands for the inaccessibility of the American Dream. At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."]}

Where in your body do you feel it?\n2- Now close your eyes and picture your anxiety. Try to give it color, shape, and temperature. What does it feel like?\n3- Does it move, or is it in one place? If it moves, tell how it is moving.\n4- Now for the good part, close your eyes and try changing this picture. Change how it moves. Slow it done shrink its size. Try to move it away from your body. Imagine it fading. Keep doing this until you feel like you can change how it feels. Changing which submodality helped you curb your anxiety? Was it its shape, size, or something else?\n5- Do you feel better now?"]}
