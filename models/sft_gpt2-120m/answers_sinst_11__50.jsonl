When a country has tariffs, the tariffs are imposed on certain goods or services, and this leads to higher prices for goods and services. When other countries try to reduce their economic losses by increasing the cost of goods and commodities, the tariffs are typically the largest.[25] The increased tariffs lead to reduced prices, which can reduce demand for products and services and increase the cost of goods.\n\nA less dramatic difference can be discerned when considering the effects of a policy that is designed to increase the cost of goods and goods. When a country spends more on trade, the tariffs follow a smaller path. When a country has fewer resources to spend on its exports, its demand for more goods and services decreases, or it becomes less expensive to produce goods and services. This is because the tariffs prevent the import of lower-quality goods from countries that spend less on their exports and thus increase the cost of goods & services.", "answer": ["What has a bigger impact on the United States' economy more than trade?"]}
